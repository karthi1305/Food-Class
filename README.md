In this project, I have implemented a multi-class classification system using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze three-axis accelerometric swallowing signals. The signals were first pre-processed using a 10-level discrete wavelet transform with soft thresholding to remove noise. Features were then extracted from the pre-processed signals and fed into the CNN model, which consisted of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and fully connected layers. The system achieved high accuracy in classifying swallowing signals and was integrated into a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for easy data input and visualization of results.
